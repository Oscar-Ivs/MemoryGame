# Memory Game
## Project Overview
This Memory Game project offers players an engaging and customizable memory challenge designed to test and enhance cognitive skills through interactive gameplay. Players can dynamically adjust the game's complexity through intuitive controls, tailoring their experience to their individual skill levels.

### Key Features:

Dynamic Grid Size: Adjust the grid size from a simple 4x4 layout up to a challenging 15x15 grid.

Highlighting Speed Control: Personalize reaction challenges by setting how long each cell remains highlighted, ranging from 100ms to 1 second.

Multiple Highlighted Cells: Increase complexity by selecting up to four cells highlighted per round.

Expert Mode: For advanced players, activate sequential highlights, requiring memorization of both cell locations and the order in which they're highlighted.

Score Tracking: Clearly monitor your correct and incorrect responses to gauge your improvement.

Responsive Design: Enjoy smooth gameplay across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) thanks to intuitive, Bootstrap-powered responsive design.

Game Instructions: Easily accessible, clear instructions guide new players through gameplay and customization options.

This Memory Game combines simplicity with flexibility, ensuring it‚Äôs accessible for beginners while still providing challenging gameplay for advanced players.

## üêû Bug Fix: Preventing Multiple Clicks and Timer Overlaps

## Issue 1
### When quickly clicking multiple cells, timers controlling cell highlighting and game rounds overlapped, causing multiple cells to highlight simultaneously and eventually freezing the game.

### üîç Testing & Findings
- Identified two independent `setTimeout` calls (highlight timer and new-round timer) causing timing conflicts.
- Rapid clicks triggered multiple timers, leading to overlapping highlights and inconsistent gameplay.

### ‚úÖ Implemented Fixes
- **Managed Timers Explicitly:**  
  Introduced dedicated variables (`highlightTimeout`, `newRoundTimeout`) to clearly track and manage each timer individually.
  
- **Cleared Previous Timers:**  
  Used `clearTimeout()` before initiating new rounds or highlighting actions to eliminate conflicts from previously running timers.
  
- **Immediate Click Disabling:**  
  Disabled additional clicks immediately after the player's first interaction each round, preventing unintended behaviors until the next round properly initiates.

###  Result
The game now runs smoothly without overlapping highlights or freezes, providing a stable and consistent gameplay experience.

## Issue 2
### Game grid starts as 4x8 instead of 4x4
### ‚úÖ Implemented Fixes
Removed
> const gridSize = 4;

Added to
>function()
  >clearTimeout(highlightTimeout);
  >clearTimeout(newRoundTimeout);

  Removed
  
  > // Update the grid whenever the slider changes
> slider.addEventListener('input', updateGrid);

Added & Updated

>  if (totalCells > 0) {
>        startGame();
>    }

## Issue 3
### If grid size slider moved, game stop working
### üîç Testing & Findings

Incomplete State Reset: When  is called, it clears all timeouts, resets scores, and calls . However, any pending logic from the previous game round (like an ongoing timeout or  state) might not be fully resolved. Make sure  is explicitly reset to  at the start of .

Empty Grid: If the slider is moved too quickly, the  line clear the grid before it has a chance to find valid cells, causing the game logic to break.
Adding a check for whether the grid contains cells before starting the game.
### ‚úÖ Implemented Fixes
### Code:
```javascript
<script>    const slider = document.getElementById('grid-slider');
const grid = document.getElementById('game-grid');

function updateGrid() {
    const numColumns = slider.value;
    grid.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(${numColumns}, 1fr)`; // Dynamically updates the columns
    grid.innerHTML = ''; // Clear the existing cells

    // Calculate total number of cells (assume a square grid)
    const totalCells = numColumns * numColumns;

    // Generate grid cells
    for (let i = 0; i < totalCells; i++) {
        const cell = document.createElement('div');
        grid.appendChild(cell);
    }
}

// Initialize the grid
updateGrid();

// Update the grid whenever the slider changes
slider.addEventListener('input', updateGrid);
```
### Code updated to a more appropriate one:
```javascript
function updateGrid() {
    clearTimeout(highlightTimeout);
    clearTimeout(newRoundTimeout);

    const numColumns = slider.value;
    grid.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(${numColumns}, 1fr)`;
    grid.innerHTML = '';

    const totalCells = numColumns * numColumns;

    for (let i = 0; i < totalCells; i++) {
        const cell = document.createElement('div');
        cell.dataset.index = i;
        grid.appendChild(cell);
    }

    // Reset scores and game state
    correctScore = 0;
    incorrectScore = 0;
    awaitingAnswer = false; // Explicitly reset
    updateScores();

    // Only start the game if there are cells
    if (totalCells > 0) {
        startGame();
    }
}

function startGame() {
    clearTimeout(highlightTimeout);
    clearTimeout(newRoundTimeout);

    if (awaitingAnswer) return;

    const cells = document.querySelectorAll('#game-grid div');
    if (cells.length === 0) return;

    // Remove previous event listeners
    cells.forEach(cell => {
        cell.onclick = null;
    });

    activeCell = cells[Math.floor(Math.random() * cells.length)];
    activeCell.classList.add('active');
    awaitingAnswer = true;

    highlightTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
        activeCell.classList.remove('active');
    }, 500);

    cells.forEach(cell => {
        cell.onclick = handleCellClick;
    });
}
```
## Issue 4
### If speed slider moved, speed doesn't change, even it's not 1000ms, but more like 500ms
### üîç Testing & Findings
**Slider Value Not Updating**: Although the slider updates the text content in , it's not adjusting the  variable dynamically based on the slider's value.

**Static Timeout Values**: The  and  functions are using hardcoded values ( and ) instead of dynamically tying these delays to .
### ‚úÖ Implemented Fixes
1. Ensure the slider input updates the  value properly
2. Replace all hardcoded timeout values with.
### Changes:
The  now dynamically updates  based on the slider value.
>highlightDuration = sliderValue * 100;

All instances of **setTimeout** now use **highlightDuration** instead of static values (500ms or 1000ms).

>highlightTimeout = setTimeout(() => { ... }, highlightDuration);

>newRoundTimeout = setTimeout(startGame, highlightDuration);

## Issue 5
### When added Cell Count Slider logic, if set up is > 1 active cell, game doesn't wait for all cells clicked, but starts new game as soon as first click is done.
### ‚úÖ Known Issues and Fixes
**Problem:** Game Starts Immediately After 1 Click (When More Clicks Are Needed).

**Fix:**  Added a counter (clickCount) to track the number of clicks in each round. The game now waits for the exact number of required clicks before moving to the next round.

**Problem:** Extra Clicks Counted as Incorrect Answers.
Any clicks beyond the required (cellCount) were being counted as incorrect answers, disrupting gameplay.

**Fix:** 
Limited the number of clicks per round to the value of (cellCount). Additional clicks are now ignored until the next round begins.
```let clickCount = 0; // Counter for player clicks in the current round

// Increment counter and check clicks
clickCount++;
if (clickCount === cellCount) {
    // All required clicks processed; proceed to next round
}
```
**Problem:** Game Did Not Reset Properly on Grid or Cell Count Change.
 Changing the grid size or active cell count did not always trigger a full reset, leading to overlaps and incorrect state handling.

 **Fix:**
 Ensured the game resets completely by clearing all active cells, timeouts, and click listeners whenever settings are updated.
 ```
 cells.forEach(cell => {
    cell.classList.remove('active'); // Reset visual state
});
```

 **Problem:** Stuck Active Cells.
  Some cells occasionally remained visually highlighted ("stuck") even after a round ended.

  **Fix:**
  Explicitly removed all event listeners from cells during game resets and at the start of new rounds.
  ```
  awaitingAnswer = false;
activeCells = [];
clickCount = 0; // Ensure clean state for new round
```

  ### Additional Improvements:

**Dynamic Highlight Duration:**
Adjusted the highlight duration (highlightDuration) dynamically based on the slider settings, improving gameplay flexibility.
```
highlightDuration = 1100 - (sliderValue * 100); // Adjust duration dynamically
```
**Consistent State Management:**
Improved handling of (awaitingAnswer) and other key state variables to ensure the game transitions smoothly between rounds.
