# üìå Memory Game - Rules
## üéØ Objective

The goal of the game is to accurately remember and click on highlighted cells.
‚öôÔ∏è Game Options

You can customize the game's difficulty and experience:

    Grid Size: Adjust the size of the game grid (from 4x4 up to 15x15) to increase complexity.

    Speed Control: Adjust the duration for which cells stay highlighted (100ms to 1000ms).

    Cell Count: Choose how many cells (1 to 4) will be highlighted each round.

    Expert Mode: When enabled, cells highlight sequentially rather than simultaneously. You must remember not only the location of highlighted cells but also the order in which they were highlighted.
    (Note: Expert Mode becomes available only when Cell Count is set to 2 or more.)

## üß© How to Play

    Set your preferred Grid Size, Speed, and Cell Count using the provided sliders.

    Toggle Expert Mode ON or OFF to change game behavior.

    Press "New Game" to start or restart the game.

    Watch carefully as cells become highlighted:

        Standard Mode: Cells highlight simultaneously.

        Expert Mode: Cells highlight one after another in sequence.

    After cells finish highlighting, click on the cells you remember:

        Standard Mode: Click highlighted cells in any order.

        Expert Mode: You must click highlighted cells in the exact order they appeared.

    The game tracks your correct and incorrect answers, displayed clearly at the top.

## üéñÔ∏è Scoring

    Correct answers increase your correct score.

    Incorrect answers increase your incorrect score.

    You can reset your score anytime by clicking "New Game".

## üêû Bug Fix: Preventing Multiple Clicks and Timer Overlaps

## Issue 1
### When quickly clicking multiple cells, timers controlling cell highlighting and game rounds overlapped, causing multiple cells to highlight simultaneously and eventually freezing the game.

### üîç Testing & Findings
- Identified two independent `setTimeout` calls (highlight timer and new-round timer) causing timing conflicts.
- Rapid clicks triggered multiple timers, leading to overlapping highlights and inconsistent gameplay.

### ‚úÖ Implemented Fixes
- **Managed Timers Explicitly:**  
  Introduced dedicated variables (`highlightTimeout`, `newRoundTimeout`) to clearly track and manage each timer individually.
  
- **Cleared Previous Timers:**  
  Used `clearTimeout()` before initiating new rounds or highlighting actions to eliminate conflicts from previously running timers.
  
- **Immediate Click Disabling:**  
  Disabled additional clicks immediately after the player's first interaction each round, preventing unintended behaviors until the next round properly initiates.

###  Result
The game now runs smoothly without overlapping highlights or freezes, providing a stable and consistent gameplay experience.

## Issue 2
### Game grid starts as 4x8 instead of 4x4
### ‚úÖ Implemented Fixes
Removed
> const gridSize = 4;

Added to
>function()
  >clearTimeout(highlightTimeout);
  >clearTimeout(newRoundTimeout);

  Removed
  
  > // Update the grid whenever the slider changes
> slider.addEventListener('input', updateGrid);

Added & Updated

>  if (totalCells > 0) {
>        startGame();
>    }

## Issue 3
### If grid size slider moved, game stop working
### üîç Testing & Findings

Incomplete State Reset: When  is called, it clears all timeouts, resets scores, and calls . However, any pending logic from the previous game round (like an ongoing timeout or  state) might not be fully resolved. Make sure  is explicitly reset to  at the start of .

Empty Grid: If the slider is moved too quickly, the  line clear the grid before it has a chance to find valid cells, causing the game logic to break.
Adding a check for whether the grid contains cells before starting the game.
### ‚úÖ Implemented Fixes
### Code:
```javascript
<script>    const slider = document.getElementById('grid-slider');
const grid = document.getElementById('game-grid');

function updateGrid() {
    const numColumns = slider.value;
    grid.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(${numColumns}, 1fr)`; // Dynamically updates the columns
    grid.innerHTML = ''; // Clear the existing cells

    // Calculate total number of cells (assume a square grid)
    const totalCells = numColumns * numColumns;

    // Generate grid cells
    for (let i = 0; i < totalCells; i++) {
        const cell = document.createElement('div');
        grid.appendChild(cell);
    }
}

// Initialize the grid
updateGrid();

// Update the grid whenever the slider changes
slider.addEventListener('input', updateGrid);
```
### Code updated to a more appropriate one:
```javascript
function updateGrid() {
    clearTimeout(highlightTimeout);
    clearTimeout(newRoundTimeout);

    const numColumns = slider.value;
    grid.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(${numColumns}, 1fr)`;
    grid.innerHTML = '';

    const totalCells = numColumns * numColumns;

    for (let i = 0; i < totalCells; i++) {
        const cell = document.createElement('div');
        cell.dataset.index = i;
        grid.appendChild(cell);
    }

    // Reset scores and game state
    correctScore = 0;
    incorrectScore = 0;
    awaitingAnswer = false; // Explicitly reset
    updateScores();

    // Only start the game if there are cells
    if (totalCells > 0) {
        startGame();
    }
}

function startGame() {
    clearTimeout(highlightTimeout);
    clearTimeout(newRoundTimeout);

    if (awaitingAnswer) return;

    const cells = document.querySelectorAll('#game-grid div');
    if (cells.length === 0) return;

    // Remove previous event listeners
    cells.forEach(cell => {
        cell.onclick = null;
    });

    activeCell = cells[Math.floor(Math.random() * cells.length)];
    activeCell.classList.add('active');
    awaitingAnswer = true;

    highlightTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
        activeCell.classList.remove('active');
    }, 500);

    cells.forEach(cell => {
        cell.onclick = handleCellClick;
    });
}
```
## Issue 4
### If speed slider moved, speed doesn't change, even it's not 1000ms, but more like 500ms
### üîç Testing & Findings
**Slider Value Not Updating**: Although the slider updates the text content in , it's not adjusting the  variable dynamically based on the slider's value.

**Static Timeout Values**: The  and  functions are using hardcoded values ( and ) instead of dynamically tying these delays to .
### ‚úÖ Implemented Fixes
1. Ensure the slider input updates the  value properly
2. Replace all hardcoded timeout values with.
### Changes:
The  now dynamically updates  based on the slider value.
>highlightDuration = sliderValue * 100;

All instances of **setTimeout** now use **highlightDuration** instead of static values (500ms or 1000ms).

>highlightTimeout = setTimeout(() => { ... }, highlightDuration);

>newRoundTimeout = setTimeout(startGame, highlightDuration);

## Issue 5
### When added Cell Count Slider logic, if set up is > 1 active cell, game doesn't wait for all cells clicked, but starts new game as soon as first click is done.
### ‚úÖ Known Issues and Fixes
**Problem:** Game Starts Immediately After 1 Click (When More Clicks Are Needed).

**Fix:**  Added a counter (clickCount) to track the number of clicks in each round. The game now waits for the exact number of required clicks before moving to the next round.

**Problem:** Extra Clicks Counted as Incorrect Answers.
Any clicks beyond the required (cellCount) were being counted as incorrect answers, disrupting gameplay.

**Fix:** 
Limited the number of clicks per round to the value of (cellCount). Additional clicks are now ignored until the next round begins.
```javascript
let clickCount = 0; // Counter for player clicks in the current round

// Increment counter and check clicks
clickCount++;
if (clickCount === cellCount) {
    // All required clicks processed; proceed to next round
}
```
**Problem:** Game Did Not Reset Properly on Grid or Cell Count Change.
 Changing the grid size or active cell count did not always trigger a full reset, leading to overlaps and incorrect state handling.

 **Fix:**
 Ensured the game resets completely by clearing all active cells, timeouts, and click listeners whenever settings are updated.
 ```javascript
 cells.forEach(cell => {
    cell.classList.remove('active'); // Reset visual state
});
```

 **Problem:** Stuck Active Cells.
  Some cells occasionally remained visually highlighted ("stuck") even after a round ended.

  **Fix:**
  Explicitly removed all event listeners from cells during game resets and at the start of new rounds.
  ```javascript
  awaitingAnswer = false;
activeCells = [];
clickCount = 0; // Ensure clean state for new round
```

  ### Additional Improvements:

**Dynamic Highlight Duration:**
Adjusted the highlight duration (highlightDuration) dynamically based on the slider settings, improving gameplay flexibility.
```javascript
highlightDuration = 1100 - (sliderValue * 100); // Adjust duration dynamically
```
**Consistent State Management:**
Improved handling of (awaitingAnswer) and other key state variables to ensure the game transitions smoothly between rounds.

## Issue 6
### Advanced Mode checkbox is not disabled when Cell Count Slider value = 1
### üîç Testing & Findings
The issue is caused because the checkbox initially isn't explicitly disabled if the initial cell count is 1 on page load. It looks like it correctly handle it when the slider changes, but not initially.

**Fix:**
Explicitly set the initial checkbox state after initializing the grid (at the end of the code).

Added these lines just after updateGrid():
```javascript
// Initialize Expert Mode checkbox state correctly on page load
if (cellCount <= 1) {
    expertCheckbox.disabled = true;
    expertCheckbox.checked = false;
    isExpertMode = false;
} else {
    expertCheckbox.disabled = false;
}
```
## Issue 7
### clicks during the highlighting phase are not properly processed and counted.
### üîç Testing & Findings
**Problem:**
1. Current Logic: The variable (awaitingAnswer) is only set to (true) after all cells have been highlighted. This prevents clicks during the highlighting phase from being registered.
2. Highlighting and Interaction Overlap: The click handling relies on (awaitingAnswer), which delays interaction until the highlighting process completes.
**Fix:** 
Set (awaitingAnswer = true) before the highlighting process starts.
Allow the click handler to process clicks during highlighting by not relying on the highlighting being completed.
### Key Fixes:

1. **(awaitingAnswer) Set Early:**
(awaitingAnswer) is now set to (true) before highlighting starts, allowing the click handler to process clicks during highlighting.
```javascript
// Enable clicks immediately
awaitingAnswer = true;
```
Event listeners () are attached at the start of the round, enabling interaction with cells even while they are highlighted.

2. **Enabled Immediate Interaction:**
Event listeners (onclick) are attached at the start of the round, enabling interaction with cells even while they are highlighted.
```javascript
// Attach event listeners immediately to allow clicks during highlighting
cells.forEach((cell) => {
    cell.onclick = handleCellClick; // Attach event listeners for the current round
});
```
## Issue 8
### The Expert Mode Slider is not disabled when Cell Count = 1
**Problem:**
1. The slider might not be disabled because the (expertSlider) element is not properly referenced or initialized.
2. The event listener might be attached after initialization or not properly updating the slider state.

**Fix:**

Update the logic so that the slider is properly disabled and checked during initialization and whenever the cell count changes.
```javascript
// Initialize Expert Mode slider state on load
if (cellCount <= 1) {
    expertSlider.disabled = true; // Ensure it starts disabled if cell count is 1
    expertSlider.value = "0";
    updateExpertMode("0");
}
```
# 3rd party code.
## Animation - bouncing ball.

Replaced:
```javascript
<h1 class="text-center">Memory Game</h1>
```
With:
``` javascript
<div class="text-center">
        <h1 id="animated-title"></h1>
        <div id="ball"></div>
      </div>
```
Created animation.js file and copied code:
``` javascript
// animation.js

// Insert letters into #animated-title with span wrappers
const titleText = "Memory Game";
const titleContainer = document.getElementById("animated-title");
titleText.split("").forEach(char => {
  const span = document.createElement("span");
  span.textContent = char === " " ? "\u00A0" : char;
  titleContainer.appendChild(span);
});

const ball = document.getElementById("ball");
const letters = document.querySelectorAll("#animated-title span");

const animateBall = async () => {
  while (true) {
    for (const letter of letters) {
      const rect = letter.getBoundingClientRect();
      const scrollTop = window.scrollY || window.pageYOffset;
      const scrollLeft = window.scrollX || window.pageXOffset;

      const ballX = rect.left + scrollLeft + rect.width / 2 - 10;
      const ballY = rect.top + scrollTop - 30;

      await anime({
        targets: ball,
        left: ballX + "px",
        top: ballY + "px",
        duration: 500,
        easing: "easeOutBounce"
      }).finished;

      await anime({
        targets: ball,
        translateY: [
          { value: -20, duration: 250, easing: "easeOutCubic" },
          { value: 0, duration: 250, easing: "easeInCubic" }
        ]
      }).finished;
    }
  }
};

animateBall();
```
Added CSS style:
``` javascript
/* style.css */

#animated-title {
  display: inline-block;
  position: relative;
  font-family: 'Limelight', cursive;
}

#animated-title span {
  display: inline-block;
  position: relative;
  font-size: 48px;
}

#ball {
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 50%;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 10;
}
```
